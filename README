simgal - a small foto album generator

Copyright (c) 2011 Michael Cardell Widerkrantz, mc at the domain

This is a small shell script to generate a static HTML(5!) photo album
with thumbnails and preview images given a directory of JPEG images.

To use, just cd to your photo directory and run the script. Then go
fetch some coffee. If you have a lot of images, it will take a long
time to run the first time. If you add images later and rerun the
program it should be *much* quicker.

NOTE! The JPEG images will be rotated in place if there are EXIF
headers saying that they should be. The rotation is lossless and
modification time of the files will be preserved.

Prerequisites:

  - sh. The script was born as a Bourne script, got changed to zsh
    when I needed arrays for the previous and next links and was then
    rewritten as a pure Bourne shell script again in an inspired
    evening.

  - ls. Currently does the sorting of the files. See at the top of the
    script simgal. Change it to what you want.

  - FreeBSD's stat(1). There might be a stat(1) in your Unix, too,
    but it might use some other options to get the same result.
    Check the manual page!

  - convert from ImageMagick:

    http://www.imagemagick.org/

  - jhead

    http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

    Used to get EXIF data and JPEG comments (COM blocks) from the
    images. If you want to add comments to a picture, which will
    be displayed in the HTML files, you can use jhead -ce or
    wrjpgcom.

  - jpegtran

    Called from jhead to rotate images. Included with libjpeg in
    most cases but can be found here:

    Yes I know about the -scale options but some viewers, for
    instance my Firefox, wouldn't show a scaled JPEG file so I
    stick with convert for now.
