<h1>Album Help</h1>

<p> In the album index, click on the small images (thumbnails) to show
a preview page with a slightly larger image.</p>

<p> In the preview page there are three images: two small thumbnails
and a larger preview image of the image you clicked on.</p>

<p> Use the two small images to go the previous (left) or next (right)
image in the album. Click on the larger image to see the image at its
original size. </p>

<p> You can also use accesskeys instead of clicking with the mouse.
Accesskeys are combination of keys on your keyboard. For example, in
Firefox under Windows or Unix, you press Alt + Shift + the accesskey
at the same time.</p>

<p> This gallery uses these accesskeys in the preview page:

<ul>

<li><strong>U</strong> goes up to the album index.

<li> <strong>P</strong> goes to the previous image in the album.

<li> <strong>N</strong> goes to next image in the album.

<li> <strong>Z</strong> goes to the full size of the image (zoom).

</ul>
